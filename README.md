A feature-rich, fully customizable soundboard application built with **Flutter**. Create dynamic soundboards with custom sounds, icons, layouts, and real-time audio control — perfect for content creators, streamers, and audio enthusiasts.

> **Note:** This project was created as a comprehensive mobile application, primarily written manually with minimal AI assistance for specific technical challenges.

## ✨ Features

### 🎛️ **Complete Customization**
- **Visual Theming**: Customize background colors, borders, and text with fine-tuned lightness adjustments (-25% to +25%)
- **Icon Selection**: Use bundled assets or select custom images from your device
- **Layout Control**: Configure grid columns (1-4), button radius, and font sizes per panel

### 🔊 **Advanced Audio Engine**
- **Volume Boosting**: Individual volume control per sound (0-200%+)
- **Earrape Mode**: Global 2x volume amplification for all sounds
- **Audio Clipping**: Trim sounds to play only specific segments (start/end time)
- **Concurrent Playback**: Play multiple sounds simultaneously with smart memory management
- **Instant Stop**: Stop all playing sounds with one tap

### 🎨 **Intuitive UI/UX**
- **Drag & Drop**: Reorder both menu panels and sound buttons
- **Long-Press Editing**: Quick access to customization overlays
- **Real-Time Preview**: See color and layout changes before saving
- **Blur Overlays**: Modern modal editors with backdrop blur effects

### 💾 **Persistent Storage**
- **Local Database**: All configurations saved using Hive (NoSQL key-value storage)
- **File Management**: Automatic cleanup of orphaned audio and image files
- **Import/Export**: Copy user files to app directory with validation

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Design Pattern**
- **Singleton Audio Engine**: Centralized sound management with lifecycle control
- **Stateful Widgets**: Reactive UI updates with proper state management
- **Service Layer**: Separation of concerns (Database, Audio, UI)
- **Custom Widgets**: Reusable components (CustomButton, SoundboardButton, color utilities)

### **Project Structure**
```
lib/
├── Models/              # Data models (MenuButton, SoundData)
├── Pages/               # Main screens (Menu, SoundboardPage)
├── Services/            # Business logic (DatabaseService, SoundEngine)
├── Utils/               # Utility functions (color_utils)
└── Widgets/             # Reusable UI components (CustomButton)
```

### **Key Technologies**
- **UI Framework**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Audio Playback**: just_audio package
- **Local Storage**: Hive (NoSQL database)
- **Image Handling**: image_picker, image_cropper
- **File Management**: file_picker, path_provider
- **Permissions**: permission_handler

## 🎵 Audio Engine Details

The custom audio engine (`SoundEngine`) provides advanced playback capabilities:

### **Volume Amplification**
For volumes >1.0, the engine spawns multiple concurrent audio players:
- Volume 1.5 = 1 player at 1.0 + 1 player at 0.5
- Volume 2.3 = 2 players at 1.0 + 1 player at 0.3
- This simulates loudness beyond hardware limits

### **Memory Management**
- Automatic disposal of completed players via stream listeners
- Concurrent player limit (50 max) with oldest-player removal
- Cleanup of dead players before new playback starts

### **Audio Clipping**
- Set custom start/end times for each sound
- Test clips in real-time before saving
- Duration loaded automatically from audio files

## 🎨 Color System

The app uses a unique two-layer color system:

1. **Base Color**: Selected from a palette or custom hex value
2. **Lightness Offset**: Applied adjustment (-25 to +25 percentage points)

This approach allows users to pick a color and then fine-tune its brightness independently, providing more control than traditional color pickers.

**Implementation**: RGB → HSL conversion → lightness adjustment → RGB output
